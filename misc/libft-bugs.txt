BUGS

isalpha / isprint / isdigit / isalnum / etc ==> SHOULD NOT CAST C!
isalpha / isascii / tolower / toupper ==> wrong fct names (ft_ is missing!)
isprint => || instead of && in while test!
strsub => while (++i < len) OTHERWISE \0 IS OVERWRITTEN!
strtrim => first_last_index() KO! (rev while test & i too much when last mode)
atoi => else if (str[i] == '+' && !neg) OTHERWISE NEGATIVES AREN'T SUPPORTED!
			beware over long max value
			doesn't support tabs/newlines etc at front...
itoa => NBRLEN DOESN'T WORK WITH 0 + \0 ERASED WITH N < 0 (fix doesn't take more lignes!)
putstr_fd / putendl_fd => putchar_fd's args are reversed in the fct call!
str(r)chr => couldn't check for '\0'
lstnew => content is not malloced (rather it's pointer is just changed to point arg's p)
str(n)str => empty string err

LIBFT.H ==> missing fromc fcts!:
	• ft_bzero
	• ft_memcpy
	• ft_memccpy
	• ft_memmove
	• ft_strtrim
	• ft_memcmp
	• ft_strlcat
	• ft_strncpy
	• ft_strrchr
